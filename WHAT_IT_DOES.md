## What it does for you???

1. checks for any syntax error and prints it out to the command line
2. reports errors in the command line/terminal as you code & save. 
3. lints them notifying you about errors via console and system notifications
4. compiles your scripts, templates, styles 
5. wraps/concatenates scripts and styles, generates source maps for concatenated files (reduce HTTP requests made)
6. shrinks the output by minifying code(css and scripts) and optimizing images
7. copies assets and static files to the respective required project directory 
8. monitors/watches your files for changes and updates realtime wherever relevant, reflects the changes to the browser immediately (linting & checking for error before presentation)
9. create a test and distribution/final versions of your app or UI without compromising the original code
