#KnightStart
#### __HTML5__ starter kit for creating HTML5 UI/UX for application intergrated with __GRUNTJS__ for fast, clean and optimised app creation

It has all the neccessary requirements to get anyone started in creating apps fast and easy.

> *Also awesome for cordova applications, replace the __www__ folder content with this and uncomment the 1st script -- script(type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js") -- in the js libraries listed in __'application-engine'__ custom tag that wraps all the JS requirements for the project*

> *NOTE: do not delete or replace the config.xml file in the www folder that was generated by 
__cordova create command__*

##### Requires cordova/phonegap v3.3 and above using the new CLI method for development and plugin loading

## Getting Started
Once you have NodeJS installed, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jheneknights/knightstart
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install
```

This will install all the things you need for running the grunt-tasks automatically.
*Note: As stated prior. You need to have a running node.js and ruby along with npm. Please install this before setting up KnightStart in your project's directory.*

#### __Pre-task:__
You will need to compile bootstrap into the app dev folder to so as to use it for development, please run:

```
$ grunt bootstrap
```

Before starting any project, you may only need to run it once. It comes in two flavours, pure css and less. if you prefer using less, to customise bootstrap, after every customisation you will need to run:

```
$ grunt bootstrap:less
```

Now you can start developing your site. Therefore use the GruntJS task:

```
$ grunt
```

This will create a __test__ and __dist__ folder with a test and distribution application version in their respective folders.

#### Live Reload â€“ Take Productivity to the Next Level
[Read Article](https://blog.openshift.com/day-7-gruntjs-livereload-take-productivity-to-the-next-level/)

One of the featuress of the GruntJS watch plugin is that it can automatically reload changes. It is very helpful if we are making markup, style and javascript changes and want to get instant feedback without pressing the browser refresh button. 

To create a test and view the test version which a compiled and cleaned dev version of the project run:

```
$ grunt serve
```

And for the production/distribution version run:

```
$ grunt serve:dist
```

> __Note:__ Grunt watch will monitor any kind of changes made to the project and reflect it immediately to the browser. No need to hit refresh button anymore.
