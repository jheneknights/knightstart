#KnightStart
#### __HTML5__ starter kit for creating HTML5 UI/UX for application intergrated with __GRUNTJS__ for fast, clean and optimised app creation

It has all the neccessary requirements to get anyone started in creating apps fast and easy.

> *Also awesome for cordova applications, replace the __www__ folder content with this and uncomment the 1st script -- script(type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js") -- in the js libraries listed in __'application-engine'__ custom tag that wraps all the JS requirements for the project*

> *NOTE: do not __delete__ or __replace__ the config.xml file in the www folder that was generated by 
__cordova create command__*

###### Requires cordova/phonegap v3.3 and above using the new CLI method for development and plugin loading

### Jade Support
__STOP__ WRITTING TIRESOME HTML, you do get tired opening and closing tags dont you?! Jade fastens front-end developement by at least 5 times. Try [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) today.

### Boring old HTML Too
Yes, normal old html way of writing markup is also supported. Just rename 'file_name' on line 63 to the name of the file you are working on. Do not add html or any extension tag whatsoever.

```
62.               file_name: 'myfilename', //eg for myfilename.html
```

## What does it do?
KnightStart basically does the following:

* Lint your JS - *checks for any syntax error and prints it out to the command line*
* Prefixes your CSS, with either custom prefixes and browser required prefixes in related styles
* Clean, concatinate(join all), and minify your CSS and JS files
* Load the project into the browser directly with Live reload support, no more hitting the refresh button
* Monitor any changes and reflect the changes to the browser immidiately
* Create a test and distribution/final version of your app or UI (whichever case you are using it for) in their respective folders

> Concatinates all __CSS__ into app.full.css and __JS__ into app.full.js or app.full.min.js after minification. And replacing all CSS and JS tags in your html file with one tag having the stated as thier sources. In DISTRIBUTION version only though.

Check out the *JS* folder where I have sorted them out into four categories:

* Libraries
* Plugins
* Scrolling
* More *(miscellenious libraries that come in handy)*


## Getting Started
Once you have NodeJS installed, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jheneknights/knightstart
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install
```

This will install all the things you need for running the grunt-tasks automatically.

*__Note:__ As stated prior. You need to have a running node.js and ruby along with npm. Please install this before setting up KnightStart in your project's directory.*

#### *Pre-task:*
You will need to compile bootstrap into the app dev folder to so as to use it for development, please run:

```
$ grunt bs

or

$grunt bootstrap
```

Before starting any project, you may only need to run it once. It comes in two flavours, pure css and less. if you prefer using less, to customise bootstrap, after every customisation you will need to run:

```
$ grunt bs:less
```

Now you can start developing your site. Therefore use the GruntJS task:

```
$ grunt
```

This will create a __test__ and __dist__ folder with a test and distribution application version in their respective folders.

#### Live Reload â€“ Take Productivity to the Next Level
[Read Article](https://blog.openshift.com/day-7-gruntjs-livereload-take-productivity-to-the-next-level/) To learn more about Live-Reload

One of the features of the GruntJS watch plugin is that it can automatically reload changes. It is very helpful if we are making markup, style and javascript changes and want to get instant feedback without pressing the browser refresh button. 

To create a test and view the test version which a compiled and cleaned dev version of the project run:

```
$ grunt serve
```

And for the production/distribution version run (no live-reload):

```
$ grunt serve:dist
```

> __Note:__ Grunt watch will monitor any kind of changes made to the project and reflect it immediately to the browser. No need to hit refresh button anymore. The distributed version is not tied to live reload since it is emulating the final version of the product as it would have displayed on user's which does not require any live reload. When developing thus testing use the default -- __*grunt serve*__

## Browser support
* Chrome
* Firefox 4+
* Internet Explorer 8+
* Opera 12+
* Safari 5+
