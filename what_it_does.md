## __HTML5__ starter kit for creating HTML5 applications and User Interfaces (UIs), intergrated with __GRUNTJS__ for fast, clean and optimised web app creation.

It has all the neccessary requirements to get anyone started in creating apps fast and easy.

## What it does for you???

1. compiles your scripts, templates, styles (both transpilation and precompilation is taken care of here)
2. lints them (checks for any syntax error)
3. notifies you about errors via console and system notifications
4. wraps the scripts and templates in common.js / AMD modules. (for build systems)
5. concatenates scripts and styles
6. generates source maps for concatenated files
7. copies assets and static files the respective required project production directory
8. shrinks the output by minifying code and optimizing images
9. monitors/watches your files for changes and updates realtime wherever relevant, reloads to reflects the changes to the browser
10. create a test and distribution/final versions of your app or UI without compromising the original code

<!--

1. checks for any syntax error and prints it out to the command line
2. reports errors in the command line/terminal as you code & save.
3. lints them notifying you about errors via console and system notifications
4. compiles your scripts, templates, styles
5. wraps/concatenates scripts and styles, generates source maps for concatenated files (reduce HTTP requests made)
6. shrinks the output by minifying code(css and scripts) and optimizing images
7. copies assets and static files to the respective required project directory
8. monitors/watches your files for changes and updates realtime wherever relevant, reflects the changes to the browser immediately (linting & checking for error before presentation)
9. create a test and distribution/final versions of your app or UI without compromising the original code

> Concatinates all __CSS__ into app.full.css and __JS__ into app.full.js or app.full.min.js after minification. And replacing all CSS and JS tags in your html file with one tag having the stated as thier sources. In __DISTRIBUTION__ version only though.
